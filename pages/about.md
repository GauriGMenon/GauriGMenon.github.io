# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, a Final Year Undergraduate at **IIT Kanpur**<br>

With a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Biotechnology, I'm fascinated by the diverse applications of AI/ML in healthcare. I look forward to opportunities in the domain of healthcare and bio-based product analytics and management.

During my stay at IIT Kanpur, I established "BioSoc", the Biological Sciences and Bioengineering department society, to promote research acumen and industrial engagement amongst students and the department. We continue to work on various fronts, including marketing strategy, fundraising, social media content creation, and event management, in addition to facilitating skill development and industry collaboration.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I nurture a deep commitment to the preservation of heritage, art, and culture — an endeavour I wholeheartedly support and embrace. 
Going ahead, I aim to leave a positive impact by merging my passions with the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.
