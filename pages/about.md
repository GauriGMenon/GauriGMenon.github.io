# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, a Final Year Undergraduate at **IIT Kanpur**<br>

Owing to my upbringing in the armed forces, I am driven by a deep passion to learn and serve. 
Stepping into the corporate sector, I see boundless opportunities in data engineering, offering a captivating lens through which we can address global challenges.

With a strong foundation in **Machine Learning and Biotechnology**, I'm fascinated by the diverse applications of **AI/ML in healthcare**. I look forward to opportunities in the domain of healthcare and bio-based product analytics and management.


During my stay at IIT Kanpur, I ventured into various activities, including journalism and scientific content creation, as well as my pursuit of music. I also volunteered as a teacher for underprivileged students communities around and outside campus.

I went on to establish **"BioSoc"**, the Biological Sciences and Bioengineering department society, to promote research acumen and industrial engagement amongst students and the department. We continue to work on various fronts, including marketing strategy, fundraising, social media content creation, and event management, in addition to facilitating skill development and industry collaboration.


Beyond my professional pursuits, I nurture a deep commitment to the preservation of heritage, art, and cultureâ€”an endeavour I wholeheartedly support and embrace. 
Going ahead, I aim to leave a positive impact by merging my passions with the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.
